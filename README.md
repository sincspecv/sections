### Sections WordPress Plugin

Sections is a plugin that allows a modular page build without the overhead and complexity of a typical page builder. It is aimed at the developer who typically creates page templates from scratch.

Development has only just begun on this plugin. Current functionality adds one "Section" to each page and post, which will then be appended to the end of the content. The default template that comes with the plugin is currently the only template that can be used, but adding the ability to use custom templates is high on the priority list.

**Development of this plugin is currently taking place in the `0.1.2` branch**
